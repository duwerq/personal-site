description: The journey into software
---


**Not that long ago,** I set out on a journey intent on breaking into software development.  A few years back I decided to quit the restaurant industry, questioning why I was still working at jobs I didn’t have passion for.  So I left and in the first time in 10 years I really started to ask myself what I wanted.  I always thought I had ideas worth pursuing but I’d never been able to fully see a big project through.

So here I was, not knowing where to go but absolutely certain that I needed something different in my life.  I  had a few buddies who were in software development but never gave it a serious thought.  My only experience with writing code was in a highschool class that dealt with basic html.  I knew nothing about it but  in my new hell bent state of accomplishing something, I started researching how to build an app business.  I read books ranging from app design to “Building an IOS Application Business For Dummies”.  I wanted to build an app but paying someone was wayyy out of my budget.

I asked a friend how I could start to learn so I could build it myself and he pointed me towards Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails (I highly recommend for those starting out).  It was so comprehensive that even if you didn’t understand the actions you were performing, he explained it with such clarity that it was akin to assembling ikea furniture.  Now my feet were wet and I tasted the sweet nectar of creating something that worked.  I wanted more.  After a quick six month stint in real estate, I decided I wanted to develop software full-time.  It didn’t matter what it took, I wouldn’t settle for anything less.

I approached a friend and laid out what I thought were my only options:

*A)  Pay 10k + to enroll in a bootcamp for partially guaranteed results*

*B)  Move home with my mom for the first time since I was 18, not worry about working for money to pay the bills and solely focus on learning the craft*

**He countered with a third option:**

Stay in Chicago and begin building a project I was interested in at a pace that worked around my schedule.  My immediate response was, “Why would you devote that much time to help me?”  What he told me summarizes a lot about the industry itself.  He said:  

>  “Someone helped me get to where I am and I want to continue to do that for others.”

At the time, I didn’t realize how much that sentiment rang true throughout the whole software development world.  Stackoverflow, free software components, endless free learning resources and community meet-ups galore.  The whole lot of them took time out of their day to help bring others up in the industry, to learn, to grow and to succeed.  It was very endearing to see that sense of community without asking for something in return.  I was now equipped with the support needed to help build my ideas.

For months though, my head swam around building an API in Ruby on Rails as my helping friend was trying to impart the bigger picture on me.  After we finished building the back-end, we began to move on to React-Native.  He gave me a basic “Hello World” set up and this time I reverse engineered it.  The unidirectional data flow and the ability to log every action made everything unbelievably clear.  It lifted the magician’s veil and all it’s secrets were revealed to me.  My first big “Aha” moment came when I was able to select a photo, capture the URL and convert it to base64 data for uploading to my Rails API [(blog post here)][2].

That sentence might have as well have been in Swahili to me a couple years ago, but here I was making progress on my own without relying on my buddy.  I’ll never forget his face too when he saw it, so proud of me accomplishing a task more difficult than any I’d dealt with before without relying on him to complete it.  

By the time I finished building the IOS app, I was equipped with the ability to learn and understand how to build anything.  I had picked up some Objective-C 2 along the way, went on to build the landing page in React, designing the logo in Illustrator and building the site you're on currently on in Ruby on Rails with a Jekyll theme.  I still have a lifetime to expand my knowledge, to write cleaner, faster and more efficient code but I learned how to learn to code.  It was the greatist gift a friend has ever given to me.

I tell everyone to learn how to code now but for those of you who feel like the mountain is too high to climb, you’ll get there.   I would stare at error messages for weeks at a time, really testing the defintion of crazy (Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results).  The second you worked through the problem though, it became an instant rush.  The feeling of accomplishment was unparallaled and made every bit of ungodly irratation well worth it. The best advice I can give if you're starting out is to keep going, embrace the frustration, and learn to log actions early on in the game.  But if you ever need help conquering those seemly unsolvable problems, go see what my friend is cooking up at [Open Chair][3].  They’ll help you work through the issues and give you the guidance that has got me to where I stand today.  

Now here I am, with paid work under my belt, a project being beta tested [(Check it out here)][1] and ready to step into software full-time.  It was a long, difficult journey but hands down the most satisfying one I’ve ever embarked on.  I recommend it anyone who's ever considered taking the plunge.

On a final note, I wanna finish with saying thank you to everyone at Stackoverflow (Y'all the real MVPs) and a big special thanks to my helping friend.  I wouldn’t be where I am today with out ya.  **Now let’s do work.**
